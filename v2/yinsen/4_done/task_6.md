# Task 6: Fix Missing Content Tab False Positives - Defect 2 (COMPLETED)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Target Version**: v2.9.1  
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-14  
**PR**: https://github.com/adestefa/legal-automation/pull/23

## Summary
Fixed the Missing Content tab to properly display both Selected and Not Selected document lists with proper numbering.

## Original Issue
- Selected Documents list was showing correctly but without numbering
- Not Selected documents list was always empty, even when documents were available
- Missing Content analysis was not working properly due to missing available documents data

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was in the data flow architecture:
1. Users reach step 3 via POST `/ui/select-template` (not GET `/ui/step/3`)
2. Documents field was only populated in GetStep handler case 3  
3. SelectTemplate handler was missing Documents field population for Missing Content analysis
4. JavaScript had available documents array but it was empty from backend

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Documents field population** - Added Documents loading logic to SelectTemplate handler
2. **Added numbering to Selected Documents** - Template now shows "1.", "2.", etc.
3. **Fixed Not Selected documents list** - JavaScript now properly displays unselected documents with numbering
4. **Updated version to v2.9.1** - Bumped version in main.go and index.gohtml

## Technical Changes
### Backend (`handlers/ui_handlers.go`)
- Added Documents field loading in `SelectTemplate` function
- Loads available documents from case folder for Missing Content analysis
- Ensures Documents field is populated when reaching step 3

### Frontend (`templates/_step3_review_data.gohtml`)
- Added numbering to Selected Documents list using Go template `{{add $index 1}}.`
- Fixed JavaScript to add numbering to Not Selected documents list
- Removed debug console.log statements

### Version Updates
- Updated server version log in `main.go`
- Updated masthead version in `index.gohtml`

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Full workflow testing: case folder → documents → template selection
- ✅ Missing Content tab shows numbered Selected Documents list
- ✅ Missing Content tab shows numbered Not Selected documents list  
- ✅ Proper comparison between available vs selected documents
- ✅ Missing content analysis working correctly

## Time Spent
- Investigation and debugging: ~45 minutes
- Implementation and testing: ~30 minutes  
- Code cleanup and PR creation: ~15 minutes
- **Total**: ~1.5 hours
