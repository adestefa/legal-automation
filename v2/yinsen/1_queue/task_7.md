# Task 7: Clean Up Preview Document Tab for Professional Review

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Target Version**: v2.9.2  
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes  

## Summary
Clean up the Preview Document tab in Step 3 to provide a professional, clean document preview focused purely on review. Remove technical metadata, file paths, and highlighted text annotations that are not needed for document review.

## Current Issue
The Preview Document tab currently shows:
- "Highlighted text extracted from source documents" section at the top
- File paths and document names in the preview header
- Technical metadata that distracts from document review
- Information that's already available in other tabs (Review Data, Missing Content)

## User Story
**As a lawyer**, I want the Preview Document tab to show me a clean, professional preview of the generated complaint document **so that** I can focus on reviewing the actual legal content without distractions from technical metadata.

## Requirements

### Remove These Elements:
1. **"Highlighted text extracted from source documents"** section
2. **File paths** at the top of the document preview  
3. **Source document names** in the preview header
4. **Any technical metadata** that appears above the actual document content

### Keep These Elements:
1. **Actual complaint document content** (all legal sections)
2. **Professional document formatting** (headers, paragraphs, structure)
3. **Legal content** (jurisdiction, parties, causes of action, etc.)
4. **Document navigation** within the preview

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify:
1. **`handlers/ui_handlers.go`** - `PreviewDocument` function
   - Remove source document metadata from preview data
   - Clean up document header generation

2. **`templates/_document_preview.gohtml`** - Preview template
   - Remove highlighted text sections
   - Remove file path displays
   - Focus on clean document presentation

3. **`services/document_formatter.go`** - Preview formatting
   - Remove metadata annotations from preview output
   - Ensure clean, professional document formatting

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Identify metadata sources** - Find where file paths and source annotations are added
2. **Clean preview generation** - Remove technical elements from preview data structure
3. **Update template** - Ensure preview template only shows legal document content
4. **Test preview output** - Verify clean, professional appearance

## Acceptance Criteria

## Testing Plan

1. **Generate document preview** through complete workflow
2. **Verify Preview tab** shows clean document only
3. **Check other tabs** still show source document information
4. **Test different case scenarios** to ensure consistent clean output
5. **Verify professional appearance** suitable for lawyer review

## Related Tasks

## Implementation Notes
