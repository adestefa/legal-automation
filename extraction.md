## Implementation Approach

All development must follow strict PR workflow:
1. **Feature Branch Development**: Each task in separate feature branch
2. **Local Testing**: Comprehensive testing with version increment in masthead
3. **Pull Request Review**: All changes require PR approval before merge
4. **Version Control**: Each release gets testable version number for rollback capability

This approach ensures safe deployment and easy rollback via git revert if issues arise.

## Conclusion

**MAJOR PROGRESS UPDATE**: Project Mallon v2 has successfully completed 5 of 6 critical tasks, transforming from a demo system into a near-production-ready legal document automation platform.

### Completed Achievements (v2.9.1):

- ✅ **Production Reliability**: Zero data loss with persistent session management
- ✅ **Dynamic Legal Intelligence**: Court-ready documents that adapt to case data
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and completeness scoring
- ✅ **Complete Missing Content Functionality**: Both document lists with proper numbering and analysis

### Remaining Work:
- ❌ **iCloud Integration** (TASK 5): Final step for complete workflow automation

The system now delivers on its core promise - transforming legal document creation from manual drafting to intelligent automation. With just the iCloud integration remaining, lawyers will have a complete end-to-end solution that dramatically reduces complaint generation time from hours to minutes while maintaining legal accuracy and court compliance.
