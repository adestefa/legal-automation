# TASK 8

**DATE**: 2025-06-01
**TIME**: 10:50:00
**PROJ**: Mallon Legal Assistant
**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: ENHANCEMENT
**PRIORITY**: MEDIUM
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Enhance Document Generation Engine with Complete Legal Document Structure

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Update the generateDocumentHTML function to utilize all enhanced ClientCase fields and produce legally complete complaint documents with proper court headers, dynamic defendant handling, and professional legal formatting.

**WHY**: 
Current document generation uses hardcoded values and limited data fields. Enhanced system should leverage all available data to produce complete, professional legal documents that match federal court standards and include all required legal elements. We should show a spinner while the document is being generated. The document should change based on the source documents in the icloud folder. We can use the test folder to test this, skipping icloud connection for now.

**CHALLENGE**: 
- Replace hardcoded values with dynamic data from enhanced ClientCase struct
- Implement proper legal document formatting and structure
- Handle variable numbers of defendants and claims dynamically
- Maintain document readability while increasing data complexity
- Ensure generated documents meet legal filing standards

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Update document header to use CourtJurisdiction and CaseClassification fields
2. Implement dynamic defendant listing using Defendants array
3. Add attorney information section using enhanced attorney fields
4. Include case classification and cause of action in document header
5. Enhance paragraph numbering to handle variable content sections
6. Add highlighting and formatting for better review and editing

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review current generateDocumentHTML function and identify enhancement points
2. Map all new ClientCase fields to appropriate document sections
3. Design dynamic content generation for variable defendant counts
4. Implement proper legal document CSS styling and formatting
5. Test document generation with various data combinations

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Document header uses dynamic court jurisdiction information

- [ ] Attorney information section includes bar number and complete contact details
- [ ] Case classification and cause of action properly displayed
