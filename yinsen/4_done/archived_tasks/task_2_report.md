# Task 2 Summary - Fix Step 3 Document Display in Mallon Dashboard

**Status**: Completed successfully ✅

### Implementation Overview

I've successfully implemented the fix for the Step 3 document display in the Mallon Dashboard. The solution includes both backend and frontend changes to properly generate and display the full legal complaint document based on client information.

### Key Features Added

1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Added a `generateDocumentHTML` function that transforms the client case data into a properly formatted legal complaint document
   - Updated the `handleGenerateSummary` API endpoint to return both the summary and document HTML
   - Enhanced the `handlePopulateTemplate` endpoint to properly process template data

2. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Updated the Document Preview tab to show the fully formatted legal document
   - Added proper styling to match legal document standards
   - Implemented highlighting of client-specific information for easy review
   - Improved the UI for better document navigation

3. **Document Structure**:
   - Created a properly formatted legal complaint with all required sections
   - Implemented proper paragraph numbering per legal standards
   - Added court formatting, case information, and signature blocks
   - Ensured all client data points are appropriately placed in the document

### Technical Implementation Details

- Used HTML with CSS styling to achieve precise legal document formatting
- Added server-side logic to transform structured client data into document paragraphs
- Implemented conditional rendering of sections based on available client data
- Updated Alpine.js data structure to handle document HTML content

### Testing Notes

The implementation has been tested with the sample client data and functions correctly. Document generation is fast and all client information is properly displayed in the document preview.

### Next Steps

- Consider adding print functionality for the generated document
- Implement document download options
- Add finer control over document formatting
- Consider advanced features like tracked changes when editing

I've moved the task from development (2_dev) to QA (3_qa) for final review and verification.

⚔️ *Victory achieved: Document display now reflects the complete legal complaint!*
