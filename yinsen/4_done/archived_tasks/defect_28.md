**TIME**: 15:35:00
**PROJ**: Mallon Legal Assistant
**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: ENHANCEMENT
**PRIORITY**: HIGH
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add Highlights Back to Preview Document on Step 3

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Restore the yellow highlighting functionality to the document preview on Step 3, ensuring that extracted data from source documents is properly highlighted and attributed just like it was in the previous version.

**WHY**: 
The yellow highlighting is a critical feature that helps attorneys identify which parts of the legal document were extracted from specific source documents. This visual feedback is essential for validating the accuracy of the document generation process and helps attorneys verify that the correct information has been included.

**CHALLENGE**: 
The highlighting functionality may have been lost during recent refactoring. The challenge is to ensure the highlighting is properly implemented without disrupting the existing document preview functionality, while maintaining source document attribution via tooltips.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Examine the current `_document_preview.gohtml` template to identify where highlighting was removed
2. Reinstate the JavaScript highlighting engine that was previously working
3. Ensure that each highlighted term is properly linked to its source document
4. Implement hover tooltips that show which source document each highlighted term came from
5. Test highlighting with different terms to ensure comprehensive coverage

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the previous implementation of highlighting from project history
2. Examine the current document preview template structure
3. Document changes needed to restore highlighting functionality
4. Implement with minimal disruption to existing functionality

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Key terms in document preview (names, addresses, dates, etc.) show yellow highlighting
- [ ] Hovering over highlighted terms shows source document tooltips
- [ ] All extracted data from source documents is properly highlighted
- [ ] Highlighting is maintained in printed documents
- [ ] Existing document preview functionality remains intact
