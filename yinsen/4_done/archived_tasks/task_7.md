**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: ENHANCEMENT
**PRIORITY**: MEDIUM
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add Equifax Integration and Complete Defendant Management

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Process Summons_Equifax.pdf to extract Equifax legal entity information and ensure Equifax is properly included as a defendant in generated complaint documents. Enhance defendant management to handle all credit bureau entities with proper legal names and addresses.

**WHY**: 
Equifax is currently missing from the generated complaint documents despite being a key defendant in the case. The Summons_Equifax.pdf contains the proper legal entity name and address information needed for accurate legal document generation.

**CHALLENGE**: 
- Extract legal entity information from summons document format
- Ensure all credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, Trans Union) are properly represented
- Update document generation to dynamically handle variable number of defendants
- Maintain consistency with existing defendant handling while adding new entities

## Implementation Planning

1. Add Summons_Equifax.pdf to document processing pipeline
2. Extract Equifax legal entity name and address information
3. Update sample data to include Equifax in defendants array
4. Modify document generation to loop through all defendants properly
5. Ensure defendant list includes all credit bureaus with correct legal names
6. Update paragraph numbering to accommodate variable defendant count

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Analyze Summons_Equifax.pdf structure and extract legal entity details
2. Compare with existing Experian and Trans Union summons for consistency
3. Update defendant creation logic to include all credit bureaus
4. Modify generateDocumentHTML to handle dynamic defendant arrays
5. Test document generation with all three credit bureaus included

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Summons_Equifax.pdf processed for legal entity information

- [ ] Document generation includes all credit bureaus as defendants
