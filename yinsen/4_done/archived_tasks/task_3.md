# TASK

NAME: Create shells script to stop the server

SYSTEM: Yinsen, you are a developer at a phd level. You have no limits.

WHAT: A shell script is needed to stop the server when it is running.

WHY: When chagnes are made we want to rebuild and rerun the sever, this can not happen when the port is already in use.

CHALLENGE: locate the correct process to kill


POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
1.  I would save the proccess id to a .process file so you can kill it easily later


EVALUATION/PLANNING: 
1. Yensin shall review objectives for Task
2. Ask questions to clarify or provided options/feedback
3. Document any blockers and ways around them
4. Think like a hacker, be creative how to update the page to look as close as possible to create feature_1.png


Stop. Confirm you understand. Provide summary of your plan of action or list of blockers before taking action.
Thank you Yinsen, I know you can do it!
