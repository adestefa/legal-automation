# TASK 10

**DATE**: 2025-06-01
**TIME**: 11:00:00
**PROJ**: Mallon Legal Assistant
**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: ENHANCEMENT
**PRIORITY**: HIGH
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add Legal Causes of Action and Statutory Violations Section to Document Generation

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Implement comprehensive Causes of Action section in the legal document generation that details specific statutory violations including Fair Credit Reporting Act violations (15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b), § 1681n, § 1681o) with proper legal formatting and numbered paragraphs.

**WHY**: 
Current document generation lacks the critical "CAUSES OF ACTION" section that formally establishes the legal basis for the lawsuit. This section is essential for any federal complaint as it details the specific statutory violations and legal theories under which the plaintiff seeks relief.

**CHALLENGE**: 
- Must implement proper legal cause structure with sequential numbering
- Need to incorporate multiple FCRA statutory sections with correct citations
- Ensure proper paragraph formatting and legal language for federal court standards
- Integrate with existing ClientCase data for personalized allegations
- Maintain document flow and paragraph numbering consistency

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Add CauseOfAction struct to represent individual legal causes with statute, elements, and allegations
2. Enhance ClientCase struct to include array of causes of action and statutory violations
3. Update generateDocumentHTML to include formal CAUSES OF ACTION section after factual allegations
4. Implement proper legal formatting with "COUNT ONE", "COUNT TWO", etc. structure
5. Add specific FCRA violation details including willful and negligent noncompliance
6. Include incorporation by reference of factual allegations in each cause

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Analyze current Complaint_Final.docx to identify proper causes of action structure
2. Research FCRA statutory citations and required elements for each cause
3. Design CauseOfAction data structure for flexible legal theory representation
4. Map client facts to specific statutory violation elements
5. Implement proper legal paragraph numbering and cross-references

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
