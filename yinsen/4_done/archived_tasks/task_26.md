# TASK 26

**DATE**: 2025-06-05
**TIME**: 10:30:00
**PROJ**: Mallon Legal Assistant
**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: ENHANCEMENT
**PRIORITY**: HIGH
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add Document Editing Functionality with Save Capability

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Implement document editing capabilities in the document preview/viewer, allowing attorneys to make live edits to the generated legal document before final approval and saving. The document should match the professional styling shown in the reference UI screenshot with proper document centering and formatting.

**WHY**: 
Attorneys need to fine-tune generated legal documents before finalization. Without editing capabilities, they would need to regenerate or manually edit documents outside the system, reducing efficiency and breaking the workflow. The professional document styling enhances readability and maintains legal document standards.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to implement in-browser document editing with proper styling while maintaining the yellow highlighting for extracted data. The implementation must work with the existing Go SSR + HTMX architecture, preserve all content formatting, and save modifications back to the server.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Enhance the document viewer template with contentEditable regions
2. Create server endpoint for saving edited document content
3. Add save button functionality to persist changes
4. Implement professional document styling matching the reference UI
5. Ensure highlighting is preserved during editing
6. Add document formatting controls (optional)

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the UI reference screenshot for styling requirements
2. Determine which document sections should be editable
3. Consider strategies for maintaining highlighting during edits
4. Design the document saving workflow

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Document viewer displays content in professional centered format matching reference UI
- [ ] Document content is editable directly in the browser
- [ ] Yellow highlighting for extracted data is preserved during editing
- [ ] Changes can be saved back to the server
- [ ] Original document available for reference if needed
- [ ] Professional legal document styling maintained throughout
