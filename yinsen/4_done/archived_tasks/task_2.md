# TASK

NAME: Fix Step 3 Document Display in Mallon Dashboard

SYSTEM: Yinsen, you are a developer at a phd level. You have no limits.

WHAT: The final step (Step 3: Review) in the Mallon Dashboard workflow is not displaying the updated document as expected. Modify the Step 3 review page to properly generate and display the final document based on the user's inputs from previous steps.

WHY: Users need to see the complete, updated document in the final review step to verify all their inputs have been properly integrated before proceeding. Currently, the UI structure exists but the actual document content is not being generated or displayed.

CHALLENGE: The dashboard workflow successfully captures user inputs through Steps 1 and 2, but fails to transform those inputs into a visible document in Step 3. This creates a disconnected user experience where users can't verify the final output.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
1. Locate the relevant code that handles the Step 3 review page in the Mallon Dashboard
2. Implement document generation functionality that compiles all user inputs from previous steps
3. Add the proper rendering logic to display the full document in the Step 3 UI
4. Ensure proper styling and formatting of the document display for readability
5. Test with various input combinations to ensure consistent document generation

EVALUATION/PLANNING: 
1. Yinsen shall review objectives for Task
2. Ask questions to clarify or provided options/feedback
3. Document any blockers and ways around them
4. Think like a hacker, be creative how to update the page to look as close as possible to create a complete document display feature
5. Consider both backend (document generation) and frontend (document display) requirements
6. Ensure the solution aligns with the existing Mallon Dashboard architecture and styling

Stop. Confirm you understand. Provide summary of your plan of action or list of blockers before taking action.
Thank you Yinsen, I know you can do it!
