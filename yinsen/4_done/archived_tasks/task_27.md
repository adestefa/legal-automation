## Core Specification

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Implement the ability to save the edited legal document to the user's local drive in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX) with proper file dialogs and user feedback. This enhances the existing document editing system by providing persistent local storage options.

6. Implement file dialog for saving with format selection

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Research browser file download capabilities and limitations
2. Evaluate HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-DOCX conversion options
3. Design the user interface for file format selection
4. Consider file naming conventions and default locations
