## Core Specification

**NAME**: Enhance ClientCase Data Structure for Complete Legal Document Support

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Update the ClientCase struct in main.go to include new fields for court information, attorney details, structured defendant handling, and legal causes of action. Add new Defendant struct and CauseOfAction struct to properly represent all parties being sued and legal theories being pursued.

**WHY**: 
Current ClientCase struct only handles basic client and fraud information but lacks critical legal document components like court jurisdiction, attorney bar numbers, and detailed defendant information needed for production-ready complaint forms.

**CHALLENGE**: 
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- Need to add complex nested structures without breaking JSON serialization
- Ensure new fields integrate smoothly with existing document generation
- Balance comprehensive data capture with code simplicity

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Create new Defendant struct with entity type, name, address, registered agent
2. Create new CauseOfAction struct with statute, elements, and allegations
3. Add court and jurisdiction fields to ClientCase struct
4. Enhance attorney information fields with bar number and complete contact details
5. Add case classification and filing information fields
6. Add causes of action array to ClientCase struct
7. Update JSON tags for proper API serialization
8. Provide sample data population for testing

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review current ClientCase struct and identify extension points
2. Design Defendant struct based on summons document analysis
3. Add new fields following existing naming conventions
4. Ensure all new fields have proper JSON tags and documentation
5. Create sample data that demonstrates all new capabilities

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] New Defendant struct properly represents legal entities with all required fields
