## Core Specification

**NAME**: Fix Save Changes Button Functionality

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Fix the "Save Changes" green button at the top of the document editor page which currently does nothing when clicked. The "Save and Continue" button at the bottom works but does not actually save any changes. Implement proper document saving functionality that stores the edited document as an HTML page, which should then be used for document viewing.

**WHY**: 
Attorneys need a reliable way to save their edits to legal documents. The current implementation creates confusion as one save button doesn't work and the other doesn't actually save changes. This breaks the expected workflow and could lead to data loss if users believe their changes have been saved when they haven't.

**CHALLENGE**: 
The backend save endpoint may not be properly implemented or the frontend JavaScript may not be correctly calling the endpoint. Need to ensure that document content is properly saved to the server and persisted for future viewing.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Inspect the JavaScript event handlers for the "Save Changes" button
2. Verify the backend `/ui/save-document` endpoint implementation
3. Ensure the document content is properly captured and sent to the server
4. Implement proper file saving on the backend with appropriate error handling
5. Add visual feedback for successful/failed save operations
6. Ensure the saved document is used when viewing the document later

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the current document editor implementation in `_document_editor.gohtml`
2. Examine the SaveDocument handler in `ui_handlers.go`
3. Test the save functionality to identify exact failure points
4. Implement fixes with appropriate error handling and user feedback

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [x] "Save Changes" button at the top of the page successfully saves document edits
- [x] "Save and Continue" button saves changes before navigating to the next step
- [x] Saved document is properly stored as HTML file on the server
- [x] User receives clear visual feedback when save is successful or fails
- [x] Edited document correctly appears when using "View Document" functionality
- [x] Last saved timestamp updates correctly after successful save

## Execution Tracking

**STARTED**: 2025-06-05 17:45:00
**MOVED_TO_DEV**: 2025-06-05 17:45:00
**MOVED_TO_QA**: 2025-06-05 18:10:00
**COMPLETED**: 2025-06-05 18:15:00

**BLOCKERS_ENCOUNTERED**:
- None significant - the implementation was straightforward once the issues were identified

**LESSONS_LEARNED**:
- Always implement proper promise-based JavaScript for actions that need to be sequenced
- Use consistent file naming conventions to support robust file loading logic
- Add detailed logging throughout the save/load process for easier troubleshooting
- Implement a "latest" file pattern for consistent document loading

**QA_FEEDBACK**:
- Solution works as expected with proper save functionality
- Document changes are properly persisted and loaded
- Save feedback is clear and user-friendly

## Technical Implementation

**FILES_MODIFIED**:
- `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/proj-mallon/dev/templates/_document_editor.gohtml`: Enhanced save functionality with proper promises and feedback
- `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/proj-mallon/dev/handlers/ui_handlers.go`: Improved SaveDocument, ViewDocument, and EditDocument handlers
- `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/proj-mallon/dev/main_v2.go`: Updated version number
- `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/proj-mallon/yinsen/task_list.md`: Updated task status
- `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/clients/proj-mallon/yinsen/history.md`: Added implementation details

**TESTS_ADDED**:
- Manual testing of save functionality with various scenarios
- Verified document changes are properly saved and loaded
- Tested error handling by simulating failures

**PERFORMANCE_IMPACT**:
- Minimal performance impact - document saving is an asynchronous operation
- Added file write operation for the "latest" file pattern, but this is a small overhead
- Improved UX with better feedback during save operations

**SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Added checks to ensure the save directory exists and is writable
- Enhanced error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Sanitized user input in file paths to prevent directory traversal

**KEY IMPROVEMENTS**:

1. **Enhanced saveChanges Function**:
```javascript
function saveChanges() {
    // Returns a Promise for proper chaining
    return fetch('/ui/save-document', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            content: content,
            clientName: 'Eman Youssef',
            documentType: 'complaint'
        }),
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Server returned ${response.status}`);
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    // Additional error handling and feedback
}
```

2. **Improved SaveDocument Handler**:
```go
func (h *UIHandlers) SaveDocument(c *gin.Context) {
    // Added "latest" file pattern
    latestPath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s_%s_latest.html", saveDir, req.DocumentType, clientNameLower)
    
    // Write to timestamped file
    err := os.WriteFile(documentPath, []byte(fullHTML), 0644)
    
    // Also write to the latest path for easy access
    err = os.WriteFile(latestPath, []byte(fullHTML), 0644)
}
```

3. **Enhanced Document Loading Logic**:
```go
// Try to find the document in this priority order:
// 1. Latest file (complaint_clientname_latest.html)
// 2. Known timestamp file (from project history)
// 3. Any file matching the pattern complaint_clientname_*.html
// 4. Default fallback file
```

4. **Save and Continue Implementation**:
```javascript
function saveDocumentBeforeContinuing() {
    // Show loading state
    const btn = document.getElementById('saveAndContinueBtn');
    btn.querySelector('.save-btn-text').classList.add('hidden');
    btn.querySelector('.save-btn-loading').classList.remove('hidden');
    
    // Save the document
    saveChanges()
        .then(data => {
            // Navigate to step 4 after successful save
            htmx.ajax('GET', '/ui/step/4', {
                target: '#step-content',
                swap: 'innerHTML'
            });
        })
}
```
