## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add "Back to Data Review" Button in Document Editor

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Add a "Back to Data Review" button at the top of the document editor screen to allow attorneys to easily return to the Review Data tab after saving edits.

**WHY**: 
Attorneys often need to compare the document they're editing with the extracted data displayed in the Review Data tab. The current workflow doesn't provide an easy way to navigate back to data review after making edits, forcing attorneys to use browser navigation or restart the process.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to implement this navigation button while ensuring document edits are properly saved before returning to the Review Data tab. The navigation must be seamless and maintain the current state of both the document editor and the data review tab.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Add a prominently placed "Back to Data Review" button in the document editor header
2. Implement automatic save functionality when this button is clicked
3. Use HTMX to handle the navigation back to Step 3 Review Data tab
4. Ensure the correct tab (Review Data) is active when returning
5. Maintain document state for when the user returns to the editor

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the current document editor header layout
2. Design the button to match existing UI patterns
3. Implement the navigation with proper state preservation
4. Test the workflow to ensure edits are saved correctly

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] New "Back to Data Review" button appears at the top of the document editor
- [ ] Button triggers auto-save of current document edits
- [ ] Navigation returns user to Step 3 with the Review Data tab active
- [ ] Document state is preserved if user returns to the editor
- [ ] Button styling matches existing UI design patterns
- [ ] Navigation is smooth and doesn't cause page reloads
