## Core Specification

**NAME**: Refactor Document Editor UI for Simplified Experience

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Refactor the document editor screen to simplify the UI by moving editing controls to the top of the document where the "Edit Document" and "View Only" tabs are, making them right-aligned. Remove the left panel entirely and make the document editing area the same size as the "View Only" tab. Only include three controls: 1. bold, 2. italics, 3. underline.

**WHY**: 
The current document editor has too many controls and a left panel that takes up valuable screen space. Attorneys need a cleaner, more focused editing experience that emphasizes the document content while still providing essential formatting tools. The simplified interface will improve usability and provide a more consistent experience between editing and viewing modes.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to refactor the UI while preserving all essential document editing functionality. Must ensure the document has the same width and appearance in both edit and view modes. The current UI has many interconnected components that need to be carefully reorganized.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Move editing controls (bold, italic, underline) to the top bar, right-aligned
2. Remove the entire left panel including source documents, auto-save info, etc.
3. Ensure document width and appearance matches the View Only tab
4. Preserve essential functionality like saving, highlighting, and formatting
5. Make sure all event handlers and scripts continue to work properly

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review current document editor structure in _document_editor.gohtml
2. Compare with document viewer implementation for consistent styling
3. Identify and relocate essential functionality from the left panel
4. Reorganize the UI while maintaining all JS functionality
5. Test extensively to ensure all features work in the new layout

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [x] Document editor has no left panel
- [x] Bold, italic, and underline controls appear in the top bar, right-aligned
- [x] Document width and appearance matches View Only tab
- [x] All existing functionality (save, auto-save, etc.) works properly
- [x] Document editor and viewer have consistent UI and dimensions
