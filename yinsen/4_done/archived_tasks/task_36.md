# TASK:36

**DATE**: 2025-06-06
**TIME**: 00:30:00
**PROJ**: Mallon Legal Assistant
**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: RESEARCH
**PRIORITY**: MEDIUM
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Context Window Token Estimation and Optimization

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Analyze the current context window usage, estimate the number of tokens consumed, and provide recommendations for optimizing context usage in future sessions. Create a report documenting the findings and strategies for efficient context management.

**WHY**: 
Understanding and optimizing context window usage is essential for maintaining efficient AI-assisted development sessions, especially for complex projects like the Mallon Legal Assistant. This will help ensure that development sessions can progress without running into context limits.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Accurately estimating token usage without direct access to token counts, and developing strategies that balance thorough documentation and communication with efficient context window management.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Estimate current token usage based on conversation history and file exchanges
2. Analyze which operations consume the most tokens (file reading, code generation, explanations)
3. Create a breakdown of token usage by category
4. Develop strategies for more efficient context window management
5. Provide recommendations for documentation practices that balance detail and token efficiency
6. Document findings in a comprehensive but concise report

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the entire conversation history to identify patterns of token usage
2. Use standard token estimation heuristics (approximately 4 characters per token for English text)
3. Calculate approximate tokens used by code samples, file readings, and other operations
4. Compare with known context window limits for Claude 3.7 Sonnet
5. Develop practical strategies that maintain effective development while optimizing token usage

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Estimate of total tokens used in the current session
- [ ] Breakdown of token usage by operation type (file reading, code generation, explanation, etc.)
- [ ] Calculation of remaining context window capacity
- [ ] At least 5 practical recommendations for optimizing context usage
- [ ] Documentation of findings in a clear, concise report format
- [ ] Implementation examples of recommended strategies
