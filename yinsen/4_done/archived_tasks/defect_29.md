**TIME**: 15:50:00
**PROJ**: Mallon Legal Assistant
**STATUS**: QUEUE
**TYPE**: ENHANCEMENT
**PRIORITY**: MEDIUM
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add All Source Documents to Document Editor Source List

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Add all documents from the iCloud folder that are part of the document generation process to the Source Documents list in the document editor sidebar.

**WHY**: 
Attorneys need to know the complete set of source documents that contributed to the legal document they're editing. This provides transparency about where information came from and helps them verify the accuracy of extracted data. The current implementation only shows a limited set of source documents.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to track which documents were selected in Step 1 and maintain this information throughout the workflow. The source documents list must be passed correctly through the various handlers and templates.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Modify the document selection handler to store selected documents in session
2. Update the EditDocument handler to retrieve the complete list of selected documents
3. Pass the full document list to the document editor template
4. Ensure source document attribution in highlights is accurate and comprehensive
5. Update the sidebar display to show all source documents with appropriate styling

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review how selected documents are currently tracked through the workflow
2. Identify changes needed to capture and maintain the complete document list
3. Update templates to display the full document list in the editor sidebar
4. Ensure highlighting attribution correctly references all available source documents

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] All documents selected in Step 1 appear in the Source Documents list in the editor
- [ ] Document names display correctly with appropriate styling
- [ ] Highlights correctly attribute content to the appropriate source documents
- [ ] Source document list is scrollable if it contains many documents
- [ ] Visual consistency with existing sidebar design is maintained
