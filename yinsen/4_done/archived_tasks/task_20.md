## Core Specification

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Add comprehensive "Cause of Action" and "Legal Violations" sections to the Step 3 Summary Review page that displays all relevant data extracted from the documents selected in Step 1.

**UI**:

Attorneys need to review the legal basis for their complaint before final document generation. The cause of action and legal violations are the foundation of any legal complaint and must be clearly presented for verification and approval before proceeding to document generation.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to implement sophisticated document analysis that can identify legal violations, statutory references, and cause of action elements from various document types (PDFs, DOCX, TXT). Must present this information in a clear, legally-relevant format while maintaining the performance of the Go SSR + HTMX architecture.
