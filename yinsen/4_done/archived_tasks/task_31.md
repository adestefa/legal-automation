**PRIORITY**: MEDIUM
**ASSIGNEE**: Yinsen

## Core Specification

**NAME**: Remove Highlights When Printing or Saving Document

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Implement functionality to remove yellow highlighting when printing or saving the document, while preserving the highlighted content itself. This will ensure the final document appears professional without visual distractions.

**WHY**: 
Legal documents that are printed or saved for official use should have a clean, professional appearance without the highlighting that's useful during the editing and review process. Attorneys need final documents that look standard and formal for court submissions and client distribution.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to implement print-specific and save-specific styling that removes highlighting without removing the content. This requires careful CSS handling and may need JavaScript enhancements to modify the DOM before printing or saving.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Modify print CSS in the document viewer and editor templates
2. Add JavaScript functions to remove highlighting classes before print/save operations
3. Implement a toggle option to preview the document with/without highlights
4. Ensure document download functionality generates a clean version without highlights
5. Preserve the highlighted version for screen viewing while creating non-highlighted versions for output

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review current print styles in document templates
2. Identify the highlighting mechanism (CSS classes, inline styles)
3. Create a solution that handles both printing and saving without highlights
4. Test across various browsers to ensure consistent behavior

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] When printing a document, highlights do not appear in the printed version
- [ ] When downloading/saving a document, highlights are removed from the saved file
- [ ] Content previously highlighted remains intact (only highlighting is removed)
- [ ] Original document with highlighting remains available for screen viewing
- [ ] Solution works consistently across major browsers
