## Core Specification

**NAME**: Remove Text from Masthead: "(Go SSR + HTMX with Document Editing)"

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Remove the development annotation text "(Go SSR + HTMX with Document Editing)" from the application masthead/header. This text was likely added during development to indicate the architectural approach but should not be visible in the production version.

**WHY**: 
The application is being prepared for a demo with the client, and technical implementation details should not be visible in the user interface. This creates a more professional appearance and eliminates potential confusion for non-technical users.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to identify where this text is added in the template structure and remove it without disrupting the layout or other header elements.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Locate the masthead/header implementation in the template files
2. Find the specific text "(Go SSR + HTMX with Document Editing)" and remove it
3. Ensure header styling and layout remain consistent after the removal
4. Verify the change across all application screens

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the main template files (index.gohtml or related templates)
2. Identify the specific text to be removed
3. Make the change with minimal disruption to surrounding elements
4. Test to ensure the masthead appears correctly on all pages

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [x] Text "(Go SSR + HTMX with Document Editing)" is completely removed from masthead
- [x] Masthead maintains proper styling and alignment
- [x] Change is consistent across all application pages
- [x] No other unintended layout changes are introduced
