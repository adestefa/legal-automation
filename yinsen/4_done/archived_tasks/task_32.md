## Core Specification

**NAME**: Implement Toggle Highlight Button and Local Document State

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Make the "Toggle Highlights" button in the document editor fully functional and save the highlight state to the local drive. This will allow users to switch between viewing the document with and without highlights and persist their preference.

**WHY**: 
Attorneys need the ability to toggle between seeing source highlights (to verify information origin) and viewing the clean document (to review the final appearance). Saving this state ensures their preference is maintained throughout their session and between edits.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to implement both client-side toggle functionality and server-side state persistence. The highlight state must be saved along with the document content and properly restored when the document is reopened.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Enhance the toggleHighlights JavaScript function to properly toggle all highlights
2. Add highlight state tracking to the document editor (on/off)
3. Include highlight state in the document save payload sent to the server
4. Modify the SaveDocument handler to store the highlight state with the document
5. Update document loading to restore the correct highlight state
6. Add visual indication of current highlight state in the UI

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the current toggleHighlights implementation
2. Identify how document state is currently saved and loaded
3. Design a solution for storing highlight preferences with the document
4. Test toggle functionality with various document content

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] "Toggle Highlights" button successfully shows/hides all highlights in the document
- [ ] Visual indicator shows whether highlights are currently on or off
- [ ] Highlight state is saved when the document is saved
- [ ] When reopening a document, the last saved highlight state is restored
- [ ] Toggle state works consistently across the entire document
- [ ] Performance remains smooth when toggling large documents
