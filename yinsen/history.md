   - The Step 3 Review page in the dashboard is not properly generating and displaying the final document based on user inputs from previous steps
   - While the UI structure exists, the actual document content generation is missing
   - Users currently can't see the complete, updated document in the final review step
   - This creates a disconnected experience where attorneys can't verify the final output before proceeding

3. **Required Functionality**:
   - Step 3 should generate and display the complete legal complaint document based on extracted information
   - The document should match the appropriate template structure
   - Client information from previous steps needs to be properly inserted into the template
   - The display should provide proper formatting and readability for review

4. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The frontend (index.html) has two views in Step 3: "Structured Data" and "Document Preview"
   - The "Document Preview" view exists but only displays a markdown summary, not the actual complaint form
   - The backend (main.go) has placeholder functionality for template population but does not actually generate document content
   - The current data flow gathers client information but doesn't transform it into the final document format

5. **Technical Components Available**:
   - Frontend HTML/Alpine.js with HTMX for dynamic updates
   - Backend Go code with Gin framework
   - Markdown rendering through marked.js
   - ClientCase struct for storing structured data
   - Template mapping schema and example for structured data handling

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Create detailed implementation plan for fixing the document display
   - Determine approach for generating formatted document content from template and client data
   - Develop functions to transform data into proper legal document format
   - Update frontend to display the generated document
   - Maintain styling consistent with legal document formatting--

## 2025-05-20 - Mallon Legal Assistant Project

**Session Duration**: Initial Analysis  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Impact**: Workflow automation for legal complaint form generation

### **Mission Objectives Achieved**

1. **Project Understanding**: Analyzed the Mallon Legal Assistant project requirements and architecture approach.

2. **Key Requirements**:
   - Create a workflow connecting to iCloud to select input documents (PDFs, meeting notes) and legal complaint form templates
   - Extract relevant data from documents using LLM processing
   - Generate a markdown preflight review document for attorney approval
   - Populate the complaint form template with extracted data in specific sections
   - Save the completed form to iCloud with highlighted changes
   - Generate a summary of changes made for quick review

3. **Technical Approach**:
   - Direct Go implementation with new Sensei server endpoints
   - PDF processing with unidoc/unipdf library
   - Vector embeddings and semantic search using Zilliz Cloud
   - Ollama API for LLM processing
   - HTML/HTMX interface with Tailwind CSS
   - iCloud API integration for document access
   
4. **Next Steps**:
   - Analyze existing complaint form structure ✅
   - Understand attorney notes format
   - Develop extraction strategy for relevant case data
   - Design summary format for preflight review
   - Implement document processing workflow

5. **Complaint Form Analysis**:
   - The complaint document is a legal filing that follows a specific court format
   - It contains multiple sections including header information, parties, allegations, and prayer for relief
   - Key sections that likely need customization for each case:
     * Plaintiff and Defendant information
     * Factual allegations specific to the client's case
     * Details about credit reporting violations and disputes
     * Timeline of events and communications with credit agencies
     * Specific damages claimed
   - The document appears to be related to Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) violations
   - Based on sample document, approximately 20 sections would need client-specific information
   - Current complaint form uses formal legal language with numbered paragraphs
   - The format and structure should remain consistent - only specific client facts need replacement

6. **Attorney Notes Format**:
   - Attorney provides structured case notes in a Word document
   - Notes include key client information such as:
     * Client name
     * Specific credit reporting agencies involved (Experian, TransUnion)
     * Financial institutions involved (TD Bank, Barclays)
     * Timeline of credit application denials and disputes
     * Types of accounts affected
     * Dates of adverse action letters
     * Specific dispute responses
   - Notes are organized in a narrative format rather than structured fields
   - Attorney highlights specific legal issues (e.g., FCRA violations, failure to investigate)
   - Key information must be extracted from these notes and matched to corresponding sections in the complaint form
   - Attorney references specific documents (e.g., Barclays Application Denial) that are also provided as PDFs
