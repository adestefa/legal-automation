## üîç Data Gap Analysis

### Missing Data Points From New Documents

1. **From Civil Cover Sheet**:
   - Court jurisdiction and venue information
   - Case classification details
   - Filing attorney information and bar number
   - Case category classification
   - Jury demand confirmation
   - Related case information (if any)

2. **From Summons_Equifax.pdf**:
   - Equifax's legal entity name and address
   - Additional defendant information not previously captured
   - Potential inclusion of Equifax in CreditBureauDisputes array

### Impact On Complaint Generation

The following enhancements should be made to fully incorporate data from all documents:

1. **Header Section Updates**:
   - Add complete court information from Civil Cover Sheet
   - Include proper case classification
   - Update attorney information with bar number

2. **Defendants Section Updates**:
   - Add Equifax as a defendant (currently absent from the generated document)
   - Ensure all credit bureaus are properly listed with their legal entity names
   - Include complete legal addresses for all defendants

3. **Case Details Updates**:
   - Include additional evidence of credit denials from all adverse action letters
   - Cross-reference dates across all documents for consistency
   - Ensure claim amounts align with civil cover sheet declarations

## üîÑ Template Mapping Enhancements

Based on the new documents, the template mapping schema should be enhanced to include:

```json
{
  "headerSection": {
    "courtInfo": "Extracted from Civil Cover Sheet",
    "caseClassification": "Extracted from Civil Cover Sheet",
    "attorneyInfo": "Extracted from Civil Cover Sheet"
  },
  "defendants": {
    "creditBureaus": ["Experian", "Equifax", "Trans Union"],
    "financialInstitutions": ["TD Bank"]
  }
}
```

## üìä Implementation Recommendations

1. **Update ClientCase struct** to include new fields:
   - CourtJurisdiction
   - CaseClassification
   - AttorneyBarNumber
   - RelatedCases

2. **Enhance document extraction** to pull data from Civil Cover Sheet PDF

3. **Modify defendant handling** to properly include all credit bureaus, including Equifax

4. **Update generateDocumentHTML function** to incorporate additional information in the header and defendants sections
