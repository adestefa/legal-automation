## Core Specification

**NAME**: Add iCloud Document Save Functionality

**SYSTEM**: Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits.

**WHAT**: 
Implement the ability to save the final document back to the user's iCloud folder, completing the document workflow loop. This feature should allow attorneys to store the generated legal documents directly in their case folders.

**WHY**: 
Attorneys need a seamless workflow where the generated legal documents are stored in the same iCloud environment as their source materials. This integration is crucial for document management, allowing them to maintain all case materials in a single location.

**CHALLENGE**: 
Need to implement secure iCloud API integration for document upload, handle authentication properly, and ensure the document is saved in the correct format and location with appropriate error handling.

## Implementation Planning

**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**:
1. Add an "Save to iCloud" button in the document viewer/editor interface
2. Implement a new endpoint for saving documents to iCloud
3. Create an iCloud service method for document upload
4. Add proper authentication and error handling
5. Implement success/failure feedback for the user
6. Allow the user to specify a filename and subfolder (if needed)

**EVALUATION/PLANNING**:
1. Review the existing iCloud integration for document retrieval
2. Design a parallel approach for document upload
3. Consider authentication persistence and security implications
4. Plan for comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] New "Save to iCloud" button appears in the document interface
- [ ] User can save document directly to their iCloud case folder
- [ ] Appropriate error handling for authentication or connection issues
- [ ] Success confirmation with link to view the document in iCloud
- [ ] Consistent UI integration with existing save functionality
- [ ] Proper file naming to avoid conflicts with existing documents
