# DEFECT 2

NAME: Missing Content Tab Reports Errors When Data is Present
PRIORITY: HIGH
STATUS: QUEUE
GITHUB ISSUE: #7

## Issue Description
When all documents are selected and processed, the Review Data tab and Preview Document tab correctly show all extracted data. However, the Missing Content tab incorrectly reports errors and missing data even when the data is clearly present and displayed in the other tabs.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Complete Step 0 (Case Setup) and Step 1 (Document Selection)
2. Select ALL documents from the case folder
3. Complete Step 2 (Template Selection) with any template
4. Navigate to Step 3 (Review Data)
5. Click on "Review Data" tab - should show populated data ✓
6. Click on "Preview Document" tab - should show populated data ✓ 
7. Click on "Missing Content" tab - incorrectly reports errors ✗

## Expected Behavior
When all documents are selected and data is successfully extracted:
- Missing Content tab should show "All required data found" or similar success message
- Should only report actual missing content when data is genuinely not available
- Should be consistent with Review Data and Preview Document tabs

## Actual Behavior
Missing Content tab shows error messages and reports missing data even when:
- Data is clearly present in Review Data tab
- Data is successfully displayed in Preview Document tab
- All documents were selected and processed

## Impact
- Confuses users about data completeness
- Creates false impression that document processing failed
- Undermines confidence in the system's data extraction capabilities

## Technical Notes
- Issue appears to be in the logic that determines what content is "missing"
- May be related to how the Missing Content tab validates against extracted data
- Could be a template rendering issue specific to the Missing Content tab

## Environment
- Version: v2.5.39
- Browser: Chrome/Safari
- Platform: macOS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Missing Content tab accurately reflects actual missing data
- [ ] No false positives when data is present in other tabs
- [ ] Consistent behavior across all three tabs in Step 3
- [ ] Clear messaging when all required data is found
