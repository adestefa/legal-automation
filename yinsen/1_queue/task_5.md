# TASK 5

**NAME**: Add Real iCloud Document Save Functionality

**PRIORITY**: MEDIUM  
**STATUS**: QUEUE  
**ESTIMATED EFFORT**: 2-3 days  
**VERSION TARGET**: v3.0.0

## SYSTEM
Yinsen, you are a developer at a PhD level. You have no limits. This task completes the lawyer workflow by enabling automatic document upload and sync back to the client's iCloud case folder.

## WHAT
Implement real iCloud API integration to automatically save generated legal complaints back to the client's case folder, enabling seamless document management and eliminating manual file handling for lawyers.

## WHY
Currently, lawyers must manually save and organize generated documents. The complete workflow should save the final complaint directly to the client's iCloud case folder, maintaining organization and enabling easy access from any device. This completes the automation promise of the system.

## CHALLENGE
- iCloud API integration requires Apple Developer credentials
- Must handle iCloud authentication and authorization
- File upload needs to be reliable with error handling
- Document versioning and conflict resolution
- Maintaining proper folder structure and naming conventions
- Security considerations for accessing client cloud storage

## POSSIBLE SOLUTION

### 1. iCloud Drive API Integration
```go
type iCloudAPIClient struct {
    BaseURL     string
    APIKey      string
    Session     *iCloudSession
    HTTPClient  *http.Client
}

type iCloudSession struct {
    SessionToken string
    UserID       string
    ExpiresAt    time.Time
}

type DocumentUpload struct {
    FileName     string
    Content      []byte
    FolderPath   string
    Metadata     map[string]string
    Overwrite    bool
}
```

### 2. Document Management Service
```go
type DocumentManager struct {
    iCloudClient    *iCloudAPIClient
    VersionControl  *DocumentVersionControl
    ConflictResolver *ConflictResolver
}

type DocumentVersion struct {
    FileName        string
    Version         int
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    Size            int64
    Checksum        string
}

func (dm *DocumentManager) SaveToiCloud(document *LegalDocument, caseFolder string) (*DocumentSaveResult, error)
func (dm *DocumentManager) CreateBackup(document *LegalDocument) error
func (dm *DocumentManager) SyncStatus(caseFolder string) (*SyncStatus, error)
```

### 3. Document Sync Workflow
```go
type SyncWorkflow struct {
    PreSaveValidation  []ValidationStep
    UploadStrategy     UploadStrategy
    PostSaveActions    []PostSaveAction
    ErrorRecovery      ErrorRecoveryStrategy
}

type UploadStrategy interface {
    Upload(document DocumentUpload) (*UploadResult, error)
    VerifyUpload(result *UploadResult) error
    HandleConflict(conflict *Conflict) (*Resolution, error)
}
```

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/task-5-icloud-document-save
```

### Phase 2: iCloud API Research and Setup
Research iCloud Drive API options:
- CloudKit API for document storage
- WebDAV interface to iCloud Drive
- Third-party iCloud integration libraries
- Authentication flow requirements

### Phase 3: Create iCloud Service
Create `v2/services/icloud_api_service.go`:
- Real iCloud API client implementation
- Authentication and session management
- File upload and download capabilities
- Folder navigation and management
- Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 4: Document Upload Service
Create `v2/services/document_upload_service.go`:
- Document preparation for upload
- Metadata addition (creation date, case info, version)
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Upload progress tracking
- Verification of successful upload

### Phase 5: Version Control System
Create `v2/services/document_version_control.go`:
- Document versioning strategy
- Conflict detection between local and cloud versions
- Merge resolution for conflicting edits
- Backup creation before overwriting
- Version history tracking

### Phase 6: Enhanced UI Integration
Modify `v2/handlers/ui_handlers.go`:
- Add iCloud save functionality to document editor
- Show upload progress indicators
- Handle upload errors gracefully
- Add sync status displays
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed uploads

### Phase 7: Step 5 Implementation
Complete `v2/templates/_step5_icloud_sync.gohtml`:
- Real iCloud sync interface
- Upload progress tracking
- Success/failure status display
- Retry options for failed uploads
- Final workflow completion confirmation

### Phase 8: Configuration and Security
Create `v2/config/icloud_config.json`:
```json
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://www.icloud.com/",
  "uploadTimeout": 300,
  "maxRetries": 3,
  "chunkSize": 1048576,
  "supportedFormats": ["html", "pdf", "docx"],
  "securitySettings": {
    "encryptUploads": true,
    "requireTwoFactor": true,
    "sessionTimeout": 3600
  }
}
```

### Phase 9: Version Update and Testing
- Update version in `main.go` to v3.0.0 (major version for complete workflow)
- Test full end-to-end workflow with iCloud save
- Verify document appears in correct iCloud folder
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] Generated documents automatically save to client's iCloud case folder
- [ ] Document naming follows consistent convention (client_name_complaint_date.html)
- [ ] Upload progress is displayed to user
- [ ] Failed uploads are handled gracefully with retry options
- [ ] Document versioning prevents accidental overwrites
- [ ] Saved documents maintain proper formatting and content
- [ ] iCloud authentication is secure and user-friendly
- [ ] Full workflow from case folder to saved document works end-to-end
- [ ] Version v3.0.0 displays in masthead
- [ ] System works without iCloud if user prefers manual save

## TESTING PLAN
1. **iCloud API Tests**: Verify authentication and upload functionality
2. **Document Format Tests**: Ensure uploaded documents maintain quality
3. **Version Control Tests**: Test conflict detection and resolution
4. **Error Handling Tests**: Simulate network failures and API errors
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow from document selection to iCloud save
6. **Security Tests**: Validate authentication and data protection

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- User iCloud credentials must be handled securely
- Uploaded documents should be encrypted in transit
- Session tokens should have appropriate expiration
- No sensitive data should be logged or cached unnecessarily
- Comply with Apple's security requirements for iCloud access

## ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION
If real iCloud API proves complex, consider:
- WebDAV interface to iCloud Drive
- Export functionality with manual upload instructions
- Integration with other cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Local file system save with sync instructions

## GIT WORKFLOW
```bash
# Development
git add .
git commit -m "[TASK-5] Implement real iCloud document save functionality"
git push origin feature/task-5-icloud-document-save

# Testing

# After PR approval and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/task-5-icloud-document-save
```

## DEPENDENCIES
- **Requires**: Task 4 (Dynamic Template Population) for document generation
- **Benefits from**: Task 3 (Session Persistence) for reliable state management

## NOTES
- This task completes the core value proposition of the system
- Success here means lawyers have a completely automated workflow
- Consider phased rollout with manual save fallback initially
- May require Apple Developer Program membership for iCloud API access
- Could be adapted for other cloud storage services if needed

## EVALUATION/PLANNING
1. Review objectives for Task 5
2. Research iCloud API availability and requirements
3. Confirm technical feasibility of real-time iCloud integration
4. Consider alternative cloud storage options as backup
5. Plan for graceful degradation if iCloud integration fails
